<h2>Significance of my slideshow.</h2>
<p>Weston West Virginia is full of historical monuments and landmarks. In 1863 the Trans-Allegheny-Lunatic Asylum was built. It was in operation from 1864 to 1994. It's now a historical museum. The historical black school was built in 1882 and stayed in operation until 1954. It was then used for storage. In 1993 it was registered as a historical landmark and is now a museum. The courthouse was built in 1927 and is still in operation. The old church was built shortly after the lunatic asylum and is also still in operation.</p><br><br>

<h2>Expanation of my theme.</h2>

<p>The significance of my theme is that all of the buildings are very old and some are even registered landmarks turned into museums. I get to see these beautiful buildings everyday. They all have amazing architecture and crafstmanship that was involved when they were built.</p><br><br>


<h3>Reflecting on the positivity of the slideshow.</h3>
<p>Most people in America do not have the chance to see buildings that are that old. Most towns have not been around as long as Weston West Virginia. I hope people who see the slideshow appreciate the quality of pictures and the significance of them to. It might inspire someone to visit one of the museums in my town. The lunatic asylum is by far my favorite.</p><br><br><br>
